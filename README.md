# World_Weather_Analysis

## Purpose
The purpose of the assignment was to help customers identify vacation locations and accompanying hotels based on current weather conditions, specifically the high and low temperature for the locale. 

## Approach
I accomplished the task by using APIs to query Google Maps for hotel locations based on latitude and longitude, as well as openweathermap.com to obtain current weather.

## Output
The customer now has a single tool that can help them plan their upcoming vacation based on current weather conditions and provide hotel and driving directions.
